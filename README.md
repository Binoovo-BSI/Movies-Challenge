# Movies-Challenge
In this test, you are expected to write a small web application using any framework to manage a list of Movies with the details.

## Backend implementation ( Optional )
Create a REST api to get a list of movies with the details or sign up for an online service where you can make calls to a movie API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) or The Open Movie Database (https://www.omdbapi.com)

You are recommended to use **Node.js** along with [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) or [**Loopback**](https://loopback.io/) to implement your backend and API layer, but you are free to use a different language/framework/libraries you are comfortable with.

## Frontend implementation
Implement a small frontend application to consume the API above.

The frontend should be able to show a list of movies available in the database. This list should have a search form of whatever you decide (e.g. name, country, language)

Upon clicking the name of a movie on the list, the user should be navigated to a more detailed view of the selected movie, where they are presented with the name, date, description and any other information you like.

You are recommended to use [**Angular**](https://angular.io/) to create the frontend, but you are free to use a different Javascript framework.

# Notes and recommendations
* The languages, frameworks and libraries mentioned are recommendations only, you are free to use whatever you are comfortable with.
* The project structure is up to you to decide
* You are recommended to use git commits in a logical manner to demonstrate the development progress
* Writing tests and adhering to development standards/conventions will let you gain extra points :)
